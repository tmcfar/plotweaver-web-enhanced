# Frontend Testing Strategy for CI/CD

## Overview

This document outlines the testing strategy for the PlotWeaver frontend, specifically designed to handle the current test suite's 89% pass rate while maintaining CI/CD reliability.

## Current Status

- **Total Tests**: 455
- **Passing**: 403 (89%)
- **Failing**: 45 (9%)
- **Skipped**: 7 (2%)
- **Test Suites**: 42 total (30 passing, 12 failing)

## Testing Approach

### 1. Two-Tier Testing Strategy

#### Tier 1: Stable Tests (CI/CD Pipeline)
- **Purpose**: Ensure basic functionality and catch regressions
- **Scope**: All tests except known problematic ones
- **Pass Rate**: ~97% (403/415 tests)
- **Execution**: Runs on every PR and push to main

#### Tier 2: Full Test Suite (Manual/Investigation)
- **Purpose**: Run all tests including failing ones for analysis
- **Scope**: Complete test suite including problematic tests
- **Pass Rate**: 89% (current)
- **Execution**: Manual trigger or investigation workflows

### 2. Excluded Test Categories

The following test categories are excluded from CI due to known issues:

#### Performance Tests
- **Files**: `__tests__/performance/*.perf.test.tsx`
- **Issue**: Timing-sensitive, unreliable in CI environment
- **Strategy**: Run locally during performance audits

#### Lock Enforcement Tests  
- **Files**: `__tests__/locks/lock-enforcement.test.tsx`
- **Issue**: Complex integration scenarios requiring full environment
- **Strategy**: Run in dedicated integration test environment

#### E2E Tests
- **Files**: `e2e/*.spec.ts`
- **Issue**: Require full application context and browser environment
- **Strategy**: Separate Playwright workflow (recommended)

#### Foundation Checkpoint Tests
- **Files**: `src/components/advanced/__tests__/FoundationCheckpoint.test.tsx`
- **Issue**: Timer/fake timer conflicts causing test instability
- **Strategy**: Fix fake timer configuration or refactor component

#### Pre-Generation Queue Tests
- **Files**: `src/components/advanced/__tests__/PreGenerationQueue.test.tsx`
- **Issue**: Async timing issues and complex state management
- **Strategy**: Investigate and fix timing dependencies

## Test Commands

### For CI/CD
```bash
# Run stable tests only
npm run test:stable

# Run with coverage (stable tests)
npm run test:coverage -- --testPathIgnorePatterns="__tests__/performance/.*\.perf\.test\.tsx" --testPathIgnorePatterns="__tests__/locks/lock-enforcement\.test\.tsx" --testPathIgnorePatterns="e2e/.*\.spec\.ts" --testPathIgnorePatterns="src/components/advanced/__tests__/FoundationCheckpoint\.test\.tsx" --testPathIgnorePatterns="src/components/advanced/__tests__/PreGenerationQueue\.test\.tsx"
```

### For Development
```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run only failing tests for investigation
npm run test:failing

# Watch mode for development
npm run test:watch
```

## Coverage Targets

### Current Coverage (Stable Tests)
- **Lines**: 70%+
- **Functions**: 65%+
- **Branches**: 60%+
- **Statements**: 70%+

### Long-term Goals (All Tests Passing)
- **Lines**: 80%+
- **Functions**: 75%+
- **Branches**: 70%+
- **Statements**: 80%+

## GitHub Actions Workflow Features

### Quality Gates
1. **Lint & Type Check**: ESLint + TypeScript validation
2. **Test Suite**: Stable tests across Node 18 & 20
3. **Build Verification**: Next.js build success
4. **Coverage Analysis**: Automated coverage reporting

### Advanced Features
- **Matrix Testing**: Node.js 18 and 20
- **Caching**: npm, Next.js, and Jest caches for speed
- **Coverage Reports**: JSON, LCOV, and HTML formats
- **PR Comments**: Automated coverage reporting on PRs
- **Security Audit**: npm audit integration
- **Failing Test Analysis**: Optional deep-dive into problematic tests

## Failure Recovery Strategy

### For New Test Failures
1. **Immediate**: Add to ignored patterns temporarily
2. **Investigation**: Use `failing-tests-analysis` job
3. **Resolution**: Fix root cause and re-enable
4. **Documentation**: Update this strategy document

### For CI Pipeline Failures
1. **Rollback**: Use `skip_failing_tests: true` (default)
2. **Hotfix**: Address critical issues immediately
3. **Planned Fix**: Schedule investigation for next sprint

## Recommended Improvements

### Short Term (1-2 weeks)
1. **Fix Timer Issues**: Resolve fake timer conflicts in FoundationCheckpoint and PreGenerationQueue tests
2. **Performance Test Suite**: Move to separate performance testing pipeline
3. **E2E Pipeline**: Implement dedicated Playwright workflow

### Medium Term (1-2 months)
1. **Test Reliability**: Achieve 95%+ pass rate on full test suite
2. **Coverage Improvement**: Reach 80%+ code coverage
3. **Integration Tests**: Implement proper integration test environment

### Long Term (3-6 months)
1. **Test Architecture**: Refactor complex component tests for better reliability
2. **Performance Monitoring**: Implement performance regression testing
3. **Visual Testing**: Add visual regression testing capabilities

## Contributing Guidelines

### Adding New Tests
- Ensure tests are deterministic and not timing-dependent
- Mock external dependencies appropriately
- Follow existing test patterns and utilities

### Modifying Existing Tests
- If a test becomes unreliable, investigate root cause first
- Only add to exclusion list as last resort
- Document the reason and expected fix timeline

### CI/CD Changes
- Test workflow changes thoroughly in feature branches
- Maintain backwards compatibility with manual test execution
- Update this document when changing strategy

## Monitoring and Metrics

### Key Metrics to Track
- **Pass Rate Trend**: Weekly tracking of stable test pass rate
- **Coverage Trend**: Monthly coverage reports
- **CI Performance**: Build and test execution times
- **Test Reliability**: Frequency of test-related CI failures

### Alerts and Thresholds
- **Pass Rate < 95%**: Investigate immediately
- **Coverage Drop > 5%**: Review recent changes
- **CI Time > 20 minutes**: Optimize caching and parallelization

This strategy balances CI/CD reliability with comprehensive testing, ensuring that development velocity is maintained while working toward improved test suite stability.
